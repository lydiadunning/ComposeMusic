-------------------------------ReCompose Yourself-------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part game part tool, used for music composition.

This project is an attempt to build a game analogous to "Compose Yourself", a
discontinued music game developed by ThinkFun. The original game allowed players
to compose music using clear plastic cards, and to use a web application to
listen to how their composition would sound if played by an orchestra.
I don't have access to an orchestra, but I do have access to the Web Audio API.

My goal here is to create a clone that can stand-in for the discontinued
website, allowing someone with a physical copy of the game to hear their music.

-----------------------------Conditions for Success-----------------------------
- kid friendly and easy to use
